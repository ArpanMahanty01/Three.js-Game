# Project Name: Three.js + React Game

## Description

This project is an ongoing game development endeavor that combines the power of Three.js and React. The primary goal of this project is to create an engaging and interactive 3D game experience. Notably, this project does not utilize React Three Fiber, opting for a custom integration of Three.js into a React application.

### Current Status

At this stage, the project is still under development and not complete. The existing features and functionality might be limited, and the game may not yet be fully playable. However, the core infrastructure for rendering and managing 3D graphics using Three.js within a React application has been established and a basic charachter contoller is completed with WASD control , run/walk switch and fly/walk switch.

### Future Plans

The project has exciting future plans, including:

- **Multiplayer Functionality**: Implementing multiplayer capabilities using technologies such as Socket.io and WebRTC to enable players to interact with each other in real-time.

- **Enhanced Gameplay**: Expanding and refining gameplay mechanics, adding new features, levels, and challenges to create an immersive gaming experience.

- **Improved Graphics and Design**: Enhancing the visual elements of the game by adding more 3D models, textures, and animations to make the world come alive.

- **Sound and Music**: Incorporating audio elements like sound effects and background music to improve the overall gaming atmosphere.

- **Optimization**: Optimizing performance to ensure smooth gameplay on various devices and screen sizes.
